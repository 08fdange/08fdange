### Hi! I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm channeling my expertise as a Senior Software Engineer at Women Who Code, enhancing backends and frontends, and as the CTO of Heart 2 Heart, a dating app I've developed from the ground up with a friend. We've taken it from concept to reality, working with a React/TypeScript front end and a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend.
- ðŸŒ± On a relentless quest to stay at the forefront of web development, I constantly explore new frameworks and techniques to elevate user engagement across applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects with a meaningful impact, especially in education, social networking, medical, and financial fields, to push boundaries and drive innovation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: React, Next.js, Node.js or all things JavaScript

- âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of coding, I'm dedicated to fitness and bodybuilding, believing in the power of a strong body to fuel creative and innovative work. Hiking is another passion of mine, offering a refreshing escape to nature.

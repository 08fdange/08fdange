### Hi! I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to check out some of my work on here! Most of the juicy stuff I've worked and collaborated on is, unfortunately, in private repositories but, I've got a couple gems in the public mix! You can also check out my portfolio [here!](https://www.frankdangelo.app)

#### A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm channeling my expertise as a Senior Software Engineer at Women Who Code, enhancing backends and frontends, and as the CTO of Heart 2 Heart, a dating app I've developed from the ground up with a friend. We've taken it from concept to reality, working with a React/TypeScript front end and a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend.
- ðŸŒ± On a relentless quest to stay at the forefront of web development, I constantly explore new frameworks and techniques to elevate user engagement across applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects with a meaningful impact, especially in education, social networking, medical, and financial fields, to push boundaries and drive innovation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, Node.js or all things JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email - frankdangelodev@gmail.com | LinkedIn - in/frankdangelodev
- âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of coding, I'm dedicated to fitness and bodybuilding, believing in the power of a strong body to fuel creative and innovative work. Hiking is another passion of mine, offering a refreshing escape to nature.
